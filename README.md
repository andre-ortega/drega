# drega.dev

I always wanted a website, now I have one. No wordpress, no squarespace, no nonsense! 

This ExpressJS app is currently deployed at [drega.dev](http://www.drega.dev), displaying my software
development portfolio from my time enrolled at the Oregon State College of Engineering and beyond. This is
a single page app with only one external route used to contact my email, for now.
