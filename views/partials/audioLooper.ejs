    An audio looper is a device that allows a user to repeat and layer multiple audio files 
    simultaneously to compose a piece of music. Myself and two others created a fully-functioning
    <span class="highlight"> multithreaded </span> looper in<span class="highlight"> C++ </span>
    as our final requirement for graduation. Complete with the basics like recording, tracking,
    bpm manipulation, panning, gaining, and a reversal fx feature, the our team built an 
    entire working app around<span class="highlight"> my initial design plan. </span>
