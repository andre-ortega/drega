This goofy project was created to demonstrate my proficiency in the basics of C++. 
My favorite aspect of the source code is how the game board is managed as a single pointer 
that points to dynamically allocated arrays of space pointers that each represent a space on the board,
which are assigned random properties on each game load. Use Indy's items to get the golden idol without dying.
Includes an intermediately sophisticated GNU makefile.
