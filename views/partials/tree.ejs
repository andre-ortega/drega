    I get called a 'hipster coder' a lot for making tools like this, but for some reason the 
    process of writing code in Tmux and Vim is one of the best ways to regularly feel 
    like a bona fide dev.

    Wanting a terminal window dedicated to constantly displaying relevant files, I wrote a simple
    shell script the does this while updating automatically using inotify tools. Made an alias
    since I use it every day.
