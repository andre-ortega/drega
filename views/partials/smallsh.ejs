    This project was the most robust assignment for the Operating Systems course.
    To demonstrate my knowledge of the<span class="highlight"> Linux OS</span>, I created a shell 
    prompt in the<span class="highlight"> C language</span>, allowing a user to run commands as any shell should. It is capable of running 
    programs in both foreground and background, manage spawned processes, route input and output to specified 
    files, and override native<span class="highlight"> signal operations </span>of the Linux OS.
