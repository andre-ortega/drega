<p>
    I bricked my Linux partition once. While removing
    executable privileges from all files in a directory, I typed 
    <span id="command">sudo chmod 644 /*</span>, omitted a necessary period, 
    and removed any ability to execute the basic /bin commands.
</p>
<p>
    After a painful reinstall and reconfiguration of my OS I wrote a <span class="highlight">Python 
    script</span> that copies my custom config files to a backup directory which is then pushed to the 
    <a href="https://github.com/andre-ortega/BackupConfigs" target="_blank">hub</a> using <span class="highlight"> 
    bash</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Never again.
