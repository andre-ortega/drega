# drega.dev

I always wanted a website, now I have one. No wordpress, no squarespace, no nonsense. Instead, all 
code that I understand and created.

This site is currently deployed at [drega.dev](http://www.drega.dev), displaying my software
development portfolio from my time enrolled at the Oregon State College of Engineering and beyond.
The site has one external route that can be used to send a message to my email.
